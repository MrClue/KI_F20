1.  Successor nodes are inserted at front of the fringe (successor list) as a node is expanded.
    Is this a breadth (LIFO) or depth-first earch (FIFO)?

    Answer: Depth-first search



2.  For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node.

    Answer: fringe: [State: J - Depth: 3, State: I - Depth: 3, State: H - Depth: 3, State: F - Depth: 2, State: B - Depth: 1]



3.  What is the effect of inserting succesor nodes at the end of the fringe as node is expanded?

    Answer: We will have a breadth search


4.  For goal J, give the fringe (successor list) after expanding each node

    Answer: fringe: [State: J - Depth: 3]
