1. What is the branching factor at depth 0? At depth 1?
depth 0 = 9.
depth 1 = 72.

2. What is the maximal depth?
9.

3. Will a MIN move attempt to minimize or maximize the utility?
minimize.

4. Are states after a terminal state explored?
Nope.

5. Are all possible states explored to .a terminal state?
Yes.

6. Is this a depth-first or breadth-first search? How do youknow? (see Python code)
Depth-first, recursion between min-max.

7. Run the MinMax tic-tac-toe program (you will play O)
Done.
